## About

This service provides following capabilities to client application via the REST API.

- Handle authentication / authorization through JWT token.
- Manage private and shared computing resources
- Allow configuration of services to be executed on each resource.
- Submit, monitor, and manage tasks and execute them on various remote computing resources.
- Continously monitor resource status.
- Decides which resource to submit requested tasks. 
- Define task dependencies and transfer input data between resources (site-to-site).
- Restart failed tasks if requested.
- Uploading / downloading of files to/from remote resources.
- Logically groups tasks into a workflow *instances*.

Although this service can be installed and used independently, it is primarily developed for Brain-Life.org project to meets its unique goals. Also, this service itself probably does not provide all necessary features often required by a full science gateway applications. For example, Brain-Life portal uses this service and various other services such as Authentication service, Progress service, Warehouse and Event services to provide features required by the platform.  

Compared to other more generic workflow services, or full scientific gateway backend service suites like Agave, this service is much more lightweight and designed to be used as a part of existing applications.  Alghouth limited in terms of its scope and functionalities, we are releasing this service as an independent open source project in a hope that other groups might find it useful. 

## Library Stack

- Node.js / express for REST API
